## UNIQUENESS

### The Allure Of  STARIN’IT: Star Ranking & Rating System:
- Each candidate’s star rating is carefully calculated by a sophisticated algorithm and serves as a beacon of brilliance, a testament to their academic achievements, professional prowess, and unique skill set.

The algorithm delves into the depths of a candidate's academic records, meticulously scrutinizing their high school grades and university degrees, seeking evidence of exceptional intellectual prowess.

- STARIN’IT also features a unique rating mechanism that allows experts to provide additional feedback on a candidate's qualifications.

- The rating feature allows users to rate others on a scale of 1 to 10, providing feedback on their communication skills, professionalism, and overall fit for the platform which is weighed based on the star rating of the rating provider, ensuring that the feedback from a more qualified user is valued more. To prevent rating abuse and to protect the integrity of the feedback system, each user can only rate another once and a minimum of 2 stars is required as eligibility to rate.

- The ratings can be hidden from a user's profile at their discretion, allowing them to control the level of transparency they wish to maintain while still allowing companies to access valuable feedback from experts.
